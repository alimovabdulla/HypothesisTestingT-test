# Hypothesis Testing with Two-Sample T-Test

This repository contains a Python implementation of a two-sample t-test, used for hypothesis testing to compare the means of two independent samples. The t-test helps determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the two groups.

## Project Overview

In statistics, the **two-sample t-test** is used to test the null hypothesis that the means of two independent samples are equal. This implementation uses the `scipy.stats.ttest_ind` function to compute the t-statistic and the p-value, which are then used to determine if the null hypothesis should be rejected.

## Files

- **t_test_analysis.py**: Contains the Python script for performing the t-test analysis.
- **data_samples.py**: (Optional) Example data used in the t-test.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `scipy`

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy
